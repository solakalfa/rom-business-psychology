      Developing Management Skills
    </h1>
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
      The challenge of leading people is more complex than ever. Traditional command-and-control managerial approaches do not work anymore, clearing the stage for much more human-focused and result-driven orientations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      We have translated these leadership orientations into habits that can be acquired. During our workshops, leaders learn simple and concrete behavioral skills. They find new and intriguing ways for empowering their team members and enabling them to expect more from themselves.

      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">Becoming a Leader</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        People want to be led by honest and worthy individuals. They will not be motivated unless they understand why. This is probably one of the reasons why we usually promote first-line managers from within; from the professional teams. The common practice states that in order to become a sales manager you should first be a salesman; before becoming R&D manager, you should work as an engineer. Whether we like this practice or not, initial managerial legitimacy of young team leaders, derives mainly from their professional expertise.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Yet, the promotion to a managerial position sets in motion a series of challenges for new leaders. They are obliged to rise to the occasion, sharpening their interpersonal and managerial skills, and step outside their comfort zone.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">Our Offering</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Though people are often promoted to managerial positions as a result of their professional expertise and positive attitude, many lack relevant knowledge or management experience. They initially perform their managerial tasks without formal training and are forced to learn management intuitively and on the go. This is where we come in.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">Developing Management Skills in a Nutshell</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The objective of our management skills programs is to train managers by providing them with a comfortable platform for thinking out loud, sharing, learning, and assimilating simple managerial tools. During the program, participants create and sharpen their managerial identity while incorporating effective habits and routines.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Before kicking-off the program, we conduct a short needs assessment. During this analysis, we map gaps in knowledge, skills, and abilities, and assemble a tailormade training program.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        This program is shared with relevant stakeholders and receives management's approval and engagement beforehand.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Next, we conduct a series of experiential workshops that provide simple and concrete management practices, develop a "managerial language", increase self-awareness and enhance overall managerial capacity.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">The Workshop</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The program's sessions are characterized by practical and clear concretization of simple human principles. During the workshop, we analyze challenging situations and present different ways for coping with daily issues of influence, interpersonal communication, managerial routines, functional space and organizational context.
